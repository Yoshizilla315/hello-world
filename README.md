# hello-world
Just another repository:
<br>Hi! My name is Austin Bartnicki (Online persona, Yoshizilla315), and I am a young, aspiring coder ready to jump into the world of technology. I have minor experience with HTML, extremely minor experience with Python and JavaScript, and looking to learn and understand these languages better, as well as learn some Java and C++ too. Please contact me at Yoshizilla315@gmail.com if you need anything. Oftentimes, you can find me on Smogon or Pokemon Showdown, with my online persona name. Thanks for stopping by!
