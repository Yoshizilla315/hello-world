  <h2>Pokemon #1: Gardevoir</h2>
    <p>This Pokemon is my favorite Pokemon of all time. I love the design of the Pokemon, the moves, the abilities, and everything else about it. To start, why not mention the design features. Gardevoir, for one, has it's own mega evolution. The design of this evolution makes it look insanely powerful, and it is, with a mind-boggling 175 base special attack, as well as having the ability Pixilate, which makes it's Hypervoice STAB, while also giving the move a 1.2x power boost.<p>
